## Pre-requisites

- Getting API keys from [Gateway Protocol](https://mygateway.xyz)
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Filling in the `.env` file with your API keys, use the `.env.example` file as a template

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
